Assessment test project for EY

Sorry for the late reply, you can find here my project.

JUnits have not been created because I am not sure how to do them yet.
Any Dependencies have not been used because I am still learning and still, I don't know how to implement them.

Just in case i did something wrong with the upload, I added a zipped verion of the project

Run the project:
1) If you have java on your computer, you can open cmd and use the below command to run it:
java -jar executable.jar
2) Import the project in an IDE and run
